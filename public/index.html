                    The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house
                    in
                    Miami,
                    Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined
                    by
                    fellow
                    widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a
                    room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women
                    had a gay
                    cook
                    named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by
                    Dorothy's
                    mother,
                    Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned
                    down.
